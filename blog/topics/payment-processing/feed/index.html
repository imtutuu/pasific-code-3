<h2>Mint Payments</h2>
<p><strong>Available to Hike users in Australia &#038; Singapore</strong></p>
<p>In positioning itself as a pioneer of omni-channel payment solutions, Mint Payments has empowered businesses to take payments to their customers online and via mobile and <a href="../../../../tablet-pos-software/index.html">tablet</a> devices across Australia and the Asia-Pacific. </p>
<p>Designed to enable retailers to perform effective revenue management, Mint Payments has been steadfast in driving a retail revolution whereby businesses are positioned to take full control of their financial operations and improve their cash flow. </p>
<p>With more than 5,500 retailers using Mint Payments, their rapid expansion has seen them listed as one of the 50 Most Innovative Companies by the <a href="http://www.afr.com/leadership/afr-lists/most-innovative-companies/50-most-innovative-companies-2016-20160815-gqsicc" target="_blank">Australian Financial Review</a>. Here are just a few of the reasons why businesses are flocking to use Mint Payments: </p>
<h3>Turn your iPad into an EFTPOS machine </h3>
<p>As retailers embrace Hike’s <a href="../../../../ipad-pos/index.html">iPad POS</a> to sell to their customers, complementing that with the Mint mPOS card reader, that connects via Bluetooth, is the ultimate convergence in style and sophistication.

<h3>Low transaction fees and no lock-in contracts</h3>
<p>With consideration for the retailer in mind, all Mastercard and Visa purchases are charged at a flat rate and EFTPOS charges are as low as 33c, making Mint Payments very attractive from a price point of view.</p>
<p>And as Mint also understands the importance of flexibility to help small businesses grow, there are no lock-in contracts to subscribe to, giving retailers more choice and freedom. </p>
<p>In adding Vantiv and Mint Payments to Hike’s growing stable of payment providers, we’re extremely delighted to be providing our users with more avenues and opportunities to take the next step in their retail journeys. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Online security is a major concern for all individuals and businesses. More of our personal information is available online now than ever before, and it is valuable <span id="more-8041"></span>

data for fraudsters. One of the most popular ways that they try and steal this information is through phishing scams.</p>
<h2>What is a phishing scam?</h2>
<p>Basically, a phishing scam is where a malicious email designed to get you to give up your private information masquerades as a legitimate email from a business or individual. Phishing emails can come across in two different ways.</p>
<ol>
 	<li>The email address shown to you is a legitimate one, but it is not actually the one that the email has been sent from. This is known as spoofing and is where the email “from” field can be altered to hide the real sender, or where the email is bounced around multiple senders until it reaches its destination.</li>
 	<li>A legitimate email address is subtly doctored by adding a character, word or even space. It is much more believable that this email has come from the company stated, and it is easy to fall into this trap.</li>
</ol>
<p>By using legitimate or legitimate-appearing email addresses, thieves hope to trick you into following their instructions.</p>
<p>What do these emails do?</p>
<p>The majority of these emails pretend to be from a bank or large organisation and ask you to log into your account. This is usually done under the pretence of asking you to update your information or change your password because they believe there may have been fraudulent activity on the account. Ironic, right?</p>
<p>The emails will normally contain a link to the ‘company website’. In fact, these are pages that have been created to look just like the official company website, but are controlled by the fraudsters. As you enter your username and password, you are essentially giving away these details to the fraudsters who can use them to access your legitimate accounts. Even if they fail to do this, they may be able to use your password to hack other accounts in your name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately online fraud is growing almost as fast as technology is developing. However there are various steps that you can take to help keep the information that you share online safe and secure. Here are our top tips to avoid falling hook, line and sinker for a phishing scam.</p>
<h2>Check out email addresses</h2>
<p>These are your biggest clue to a phishing attack. Always check the origin of any emails that you aren’t expecting, particularly if they contain requests to sign into an account or click on a link.</p>
<p>Many phishing emails will try to panic you into clicking and logging in, possibly by telling you that your account has been compromised, or by telling you that you have won a prize. Don’t feel rushed, take your time and check that the email address is legit by comparing it to one of the emails you have previously received.</p>
<h2>Examine everything closely</h2>
<p>From the email itself to the webpage that the link leads to (if you do click on it), be vigilant. Thieves are very good at producing almost perfect copies of company emails and web pages, but even the slightest thing being off could alert you to a potential phishing scam.</p>
<p>Ensure that logos, layouts and formatting all seem legit by comparing it to any communications you have previously received. Even something as small as using slightly the wrong shade of blue could indicate that something is amiss.</p>
<p>Trust your gut, if it feels and seems ‘off’, it probably is!</p>
<h2>Don’t get click happy</h2>
<p>Don’t just automatically get drawn into clicking on the link in the email. If you place your cursor over it then the full web address should come up. Secure websites like those used by banks and large corporations will begin with http, so you know that you can trust them.</p>
<p>If you are in any doubt at all, avoid the link altogether and instead go to the website in it independently. That way you can be sure you are logging into the real thing!</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to ask</h2>
<p>No company is going to jump down your throat for asking them if an email from them is legit. Contact the customer service department of the company that the email is supposedly from, and verify its authenticity.</p>
<p>Not only could you help save other people from the same phishing scam by making the business aware that someone is phishing using their name and giving them the opportunity to warn their customers, but you are also alerting them to the fact their database may have been hacked.</p>
<p>If you are ever concerned about an email that you have received from us here at <a href="../../../../index.html">Hike</a>, please feel free to contact us to get verification on its origin.</p>
<h2>What do I do if I think I have been phished?</h2>
<p>If you suspect that you have fallen for a phishing scam then the first thing that you should do is change the passwords for all of your online accounts, and in particular on the legitimate website mentioned in the email. Changing ‘password’ for ‘password1’ isn’t going to cut it, so come up with something original and in no way, shape or form linked to your old passwords!</p>
<p>Then you should notify the company used in the attack and inform them that you believe that your account may have been compromised. They should then be able to confirm if any fraudulent activity has taken place.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that online security will continue to be a major concern heading into the future. However using a little bit of investigative work and a whole lot of common sense, we can still defeat the cyber-thieves and avoid falling hook, line and sinker for a phishing scam.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../how-to-avoid-a-phishing-scam/index.html">How to avoid falling hook, line and sinker for a phishing scam</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If your business has not yet shifted to EMV / Chip and PIN payment processing then you need to think about making this change sooner rather than later.<span id="more-6764"></span>

</p>

<p>Whilst you want to ensure that your customers are not targeted by card fraud, your business also needs to be protected at the same time. Visa, Discover, Mastercard and Amex have announced that they will be making merchants who have not embraced <a href="../../../understanding-emv-chip-card-technology/index.html">chip and PIN payment processing</a> liable for the cost of any fraud that may occur as a result of any of their POS transactions.</p>

<p>Here is the compliance deadlines that businesses with <a href="../../../../retail-software/index.html">retail POS systems</a> need to know.</p>
<h2>Canada</h2>
<p>Whilst Amex, Mastercard and Visa all implemented a liability shift in 2012, Discover and Interac are slower to follow.</p>
<p>Interac will stop processing non-EMV transactions at <strong>POS</strong> terminals after 31 December 2015.</p>

<p>Discover will shift liability for fraud to the merchant on 1 October 2015. Pay at pump gas stations will have until 1 October 2017 to become EMV compliant.</p>

<p>Mexico<br/>
With all major card issuers having already passed liability to merchants, Discover will implement their liability shift on 1 October 2015, with pay at pump gas stations affected from 1 October 2017.</p>
<h2>United States</h2>
<p>Amex, Discover, Mastercard and Visa will all shift liability for fraudulent <strong>POS</strong> transactions to the merchant from 1 October 2015. Pay at pump gas stations will have until 1 October 2017 to become compliant.</p>

<p>The transition to all consumers in these countries having EMV cards is currently taking place as banks and card companies roll out the new style cards in phases. Debit cards are taking significantly longer as bank retailers are also changing their own software to accept them.</p>

<p>We know how important it is to ensure that you are giving your customers the efficient and secure spending experience that they require. Evolving to EMV technology for your <a href="../../../../index.html">point of sale</a> will keep your transactions safe for both your customers and your business.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../deadline-is-approaching-is-your-pos-emv-ready/index.html">Deadline is approaching &#8211; Is your point of sale EMV ready?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us take EMV Chip Card technology for granted, accepting it as the method which we must now use to make debit or credit card transactions.<span id="more-6767"></span>

 However not so long ago we were watching our cards get swiped and signing receipts in order to make payments. So what has changed? What really is <strong>EMV chip card technology</strong> and why is beneficial for businesses and consumers alike?</p>

<p>“EMV® is a global standard for credit and debit payment cards based on chip card technology”.</p>

<p>The name EMV comes from Europay, Mastercard and Visa who developed the system we now use for most cashless transactions. It was established as a way of processing payments from cards that contain microchips which is why it is commonly known as ‘chip and PIN’. For those <a href="../../../../retail-software/index.html"><strong>retail POS systems</strong></a> that accept it, the requirement of a personal PIN code acts as an additional layer of cardholder verification on an already secure process.</p>
<h3>So what are the main differences between EMV chip &amp; pin transactions and magnetic stripe swiping?</h3>
<p>The most significant difference is the level of data that is shared. When payments are processed using just the magnetic stripe, the only information that is actually shared is the card number and expiry date. However when using EMV chip card technology there is much more data shared and this requires much greater processing.</p>

<p>The other difference is the level of security each method of payment provides your customers and your business. With favourite fraud techniques usually always resorting to the weakest technology, magnetic stripe cards and transactions are the easiest target. Fraudsters have found that they can use inexpensive card reading devices to copy the information stored on the magnetic stripes of cards. This means they will have access to your card number and card expiry date. This process is known as skimming and has been found worldwide. It is particularly easy to do if at the <a href="../../../../index.html">point of sale</a> you are asked to hand your card over for the cashier to swipe, rather than doing it yourself.</p>

<p>When using chip and PIN to complete a payment, a unique transaction code is created each time using a cryptographic key. It is this code along with the entry of a personal pin code that makes stolen data less useful to thieves. The card details are only a part of the information needed in order to spend. Even if a thief managed to obtain card details, they would not have the capability of creating a transaction code for in-store purchases. The POS device will verify the use of the card by piecing together and ensuring the authenticity of all of the individual security measures.</p>

<p>As of today, many payment providers are already offering the technology and our POS system already integrates with best of those so you can choose from a list of <a href="../../../which-payment-gateway-is-right-for-your-business/index.html">payment gateway providers</a> that is best for your business.</p>
<h3>What about security for ‘card not present’ (CNP) transactions?</h3>
<p>Standard online fraud protection usually requests additional information in the form of address or card security code verification. However some businesses are taking this a step further in order to protect themselves and their customers from fraudulent transactions. The implementation of additional security questions is becoming common for those businesses that take payments from regular customers. Examples of the additional information they are requesting includes date of birth, middle name or password which the cashier (for telephone transactions) or system can then match to a customer profile.</p>

<p>Many online transactions are also protected by the systems set in place by the major card companies. These include ‘Verified by Visa’, ‘Mastercard Securecode’ and ‘American Express SafeKey’.</p>
<h3>Can Chip cards be used at retailers that do not support EMV technology?</h3>
<p>Yes, they can. Your magnetic stripe can still be swiped, but you will not have the added security that comes with chip-reading and entering a personal PIN code.</p>

<p>However there are a number of changes approaching with regards to the processing of non-EMV technology payments.</p>

<p>However in the United States, Mexico and Canada there are a number of changes approaching with regards to the processing of non-EMV technology payments. Look out for our article ‘How card payment liability is changing (US, Mexican and Canadian businesses) – get your POS ready for October 2015’ for the information you need to know.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../understanding-emv-chip-card-technology/index.html">Understanding EMV Chip Card Technology</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

 your customers to spend with you. <!--more-->Getting the right payment gateway for your <strong>POS</strong> is vital to support the ongoing function of your business, and your ability to turn a profit.</p>
<h2>What is a payment gateway?</h2>
<p>Put simply, a payment gateway is the equivalent of A payment gateway is an eCommerce solution in the form of software that authorizes credit card payments for businesses. It is the equivalent of <strong>POS</strong> terminals seen in retail outlets. However as well as in bricks and mortar stores, it can also be used for online transactions.</p>
<h2>How do I know what is best for my customers?</h2>
<p>Offering your customers with an efficient and convenient payment process is critical. If the transaction is too confusing or a time consuming then they may give up and go elsewhere. When deciding on your choice of payment gateway, one of the key considerations you need to make is what will work best for your customers based on the type of product or service that you are providing.</p>

<p>For example, if you are a store selling items with an average price of $500 or more, you can reasonably expect that the majority of your customers will make purchases using card rather than cash. Alternatively if you have a store that sells items with an average value of $10 then you need to ensure that you have the option for your customers to pay using cash in addition to using a payment gateway at your <a href="../../../../index.html">point of sale</a>. You should also look at factors such as whether your in-store payments are bigger than online payments or vise versa.</p>
<h2>Online Transactions</h2>
<p>These days there are many payment gateway available out there that integrate with renowned <a href="../../../../index.html">point of sale software</a> systems. Though it is difficult for us to compare them all, we&#8217;ve prepared a basic comparison for 3 selected online payment gateways. We hope this comparison will help you get started with your search and provide with some comparison criterion to look for based on your requirement.</p>

<p>The three payment gateways we selected for the comparison are Stripe, PayPal and eWAY. For each of these we are going to compare three areas of consideration in order to help you decide which is right for your business.</p>

<p>Please note: This article was written on 23rd June 2015. Rates and other comparison are based on information available to us at the time of writing this article.</p>

<h2>PayPal</h2>
<p>Probably the online payment gateway that most people are familiar with, Paypal allows any individual, sole trader or business to safely send and receive money. All that is needed is an email address. It initially had a stronger presence in the world of online auctions and private sales. However, it is now increasingly being used for business transactions including services, digital content and tangible products.</p>

<p>At POS Transactions<br/>
Payment gateways are also needed at traditional <strong>point of sale</strong> counters in physical stores. Many businesses and retail outlets are moving towards more efficient and paperless card based transactions. That said, there are still a percentage of people who prefer to use cash instead of POS gateways as so you will need to ensure that your business still has this capability.</p>
<h2>Cash</h2>
<p>The most traditional form of payment; using cash is simple, quick and easy.</p>
<h3>Set up</h3>
<p>You will need a cash drawer or cash box at your POS to store the money that you take, and this will need a daily ‘float’ to ensure that you have enough change to give customers. You will also need to set up a merchant bank account to keep track of your money, and deposit your takings yourself on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Apart from the initial investment in a cash drawer, there is very little cost involved in setting your business up for cash payments. However, if you are looking to employ a money transporter service then these will incur an additional monthly fee.</p>
<h2>EFTPOS</h2>
<p>EFTPOS stands for ‘Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale’ and allows customers to make card payments at any physical POS by reading a card and getting authorization from card issuer bank to complete the transaction. At some EFTPOS terminals (based on business’s policy), customers are also able to do’cash out’ transactions in addition to their purchases, saving them a trip to an ATM.</p>
<h3>Set up</h3>
<p>In order to set up this payment processing gateway you need to have a ‘merchant account’ with your bank. The EFTPOS then links to this merchant account to transfer the funds from the customers’ bank to your account.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>This may vary depending on your transaction size, volume and various other factors. Please ask your business bank account manager directly for more information.</p>
<h2>Paypal Here</h2>
<p>PayPal now also offers PayPal Here for in-store payments. The chip &amp; pin technology is considered as <a href="../../../future-of-in-store-payment-processing/index.html">future of in-store payment processing</a>. Using Bluetooth technology, the Paypal Here app links your mobile phone or tablet to the card reader in order to take payments, eliminating the need for a physical wire connection.</p>
<h3>Set up</h3>
<p>In order to use this service you need to ensure that your Paypal account has been upgraded to PayPal Premier or Business. PayPal Here works with its dedicated Chip and PIN POS hardware.</p>
<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Paypal charges 2.75% for purchases made using Chip and PIN cards and Paypal check in.<br/>
However, it charges 3.4% + 20p for card payments for transactions made by swiping the magnetic stripe or manually entering card details.</p>

<p>Whether your business is big or small and provides a service or goods, there is a payment gateway out there to suit your needs. We hope that this article has been helpful and informative in your decision-making process.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../which-payment-gateway-is-right-for-your-business/index.html">Which payment gateway is right for your business?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technology is continuing to evolve at an exponential rate and the changes can be difficult to keep up with. There always seems to be some new software<span id="more-6617"></span>

 or hardware to get to grips with and the payment processing industry is no exception. Whilst we have already seen some massive leaps in where, how and when we can make payments, we can expect considerably more developments in the next decade.</p>

<p>A brief look at the history of payment processing system can tell us a lot about how far the industry has come in such a short time. The original payment processing terminals began life as a simple system comprising of a low-powered processor, keypad, single-line display and modem. They were not able to support any external devices like pin pads or printers. The rapid evolution to customer-facing terminals a few years later saw the introduction of color displays, pin pads and sexy 32-bit processors. The change was akin to going from a Nokia 6210 to an iPhone.</p>
<p>But of course, tech-types didn’t stop there, and the better technology becomes, the more consumer expectations grow. Streamlining payments to make them simpler and more secure is part of creating an efficient, non-invasive and high-quality spending experience. In order to keep businesses successful and customers happy we need to embrace these demands. To do this we must ensure that our payment processing devices and <a href="../../../../software-features/point-of-sale/index.html">POS systems</a> have the capability to accept these new technologies.</p>

<p>So what direction can we expect payment processing technology to take?</p>

<p>Currently, almost all customer-facing terminals systems accept smart cards. These are the credit/debit cards that have the microchip in that mean that customers only need to enter their personal pin number into a keypad to make a payment. A more recent development is the growing preference for contactless payment which just requires close proximity between your smart card and the terminal. Usually used for smaller payments, some credit card companies and banks have actually capped spending limits which adds to the strong security measures the system has in place.</p>
<p>Both chip and pin and contactless transactions work with regular cash registers. However, they are also exceptionally well suited to <a href="../../../../cloud-pos/index.html">cloud POS</a> owing to their portable nature. With transactions being undertaken on iPad or other <a href="../../../../mobile-pos/index.html">mobile POS</a> device, cashless payments can be made anywhere, anytime. An added benefit of cloud-based POS is that receipts can be emailed directly to the customer, streamlining the process further</p>

<p>As we move into the future one form of payment processing that is predicted to become extremely popular is the ability to make payments using your mobile phone. Using a process known as near field communication (NFC for short), experts believe that many of us will embrace this new system as a secure way to make transactions, eliminating the need for credit cards and cash altogether.</p>
<p>There is no definite way to predict the future of payment processing technology. However, we can be certain that consumer demand and expectation will continue to grow. Whether your POS is currently traditional or cloud-based, being able to adapt to new developments is going to be vital to the sustainability and growth of your business.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../future-of-in-store-payment-processing/index.html">Future of in-store payment processing</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>
