										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A logo is arguably one of the most powerful identifiers of any business. <span id="more-47619"></span>In fact, logos are so effective that most of us are able to identify many of the brands we come across in our day to day life simply by the logo they use. This is possible because they have created great logos that stick in our minds are as easy to recall within just a few seconds. </p>



<p>If your business doesn’t have a logo yet, getting one sorted should be a priority. But where do you start? What makes a killer logo? Here’s what you need to know about the steps needed to design the perfect logo for your brand.</p>



<h2>Why is a logo important?</h2>



<p>A logo is often the very first thing that prospective customers see and is crucial to the impression that your brand makes. Visual communication is one of the most effective tools any business has, so getting it right is essential. Not only can your logo help you to stand out from the competition and let people know what your business stands for, but if you create branded swag, it can remind people who you are. </p>



<h2>What makes a good logo?</h2>



<p>One of the most important things to be aware of is the characteristics that define a great logo. This will be hugely valuable in the creation process. An effective logo is:</p>



<ul><li>Unique</li><li>Distinctive </li><li>Memorable</li><li>Versatile and can be used in any size and location </li><li>Reflects your brand identity</li><li>Timeless and will not need to be altered unless you rebrand the business in the future</li></ul>



<p>These elements should form your checklist when it comes to designing your logo. </p>



<h2>Decide on your brand identity</h2>



<p>A brand identity is a lot like a personal identity and to discover it, you need to ask yourself a range of questions. These can include:</p>



<p>What is your brand’s core personality?</p>



<p>What is the reason you started your business? </p>



<p>What are your key company values?</p>



<p>What do you want people’s impression of your brand to be?</p>



<p>Answering these questions will help to develop your brand identity, which in turn will make it easier to make design choices that portray your message to the masses. </p>



<h2>Seek inspiration for your design</h2>



<p>Putting pen to paper and coming up with the initial concept for your logo is often the hardest part of the process. Brainstorming ideas with your team can really help as often, the best concepts are born out of conversations with others. Other people who prefer to work visually will create a brainstorming board or mood board. There are also some great resources online where you can check out unique designs that could inspire you. These include: </p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.logoed.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Logoed</a></li>
	<li><a title="Logospire" href="https://logospire.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Logospire</a></li>
	<li><a title="Brand New" href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Brand New</a></li>
	<li><a title="logolounge" href="https://www.logolounge.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">logolounge</a></li>
	<li><a title="logo design love" href="https://www.logodesignlove.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">logo design love</a></li>
</ul>



<h2>Evaluate your competition</h2>



<p>Your competitors may have some great ideas in their logos, and this can certainly help inspire you. Nevertheless, you want your logo to set you apart from the competition and that means that you need to make sure it’s completely different. For example, if your major competitor is using black and white, make your logo stand out by using a splash of color. Check out the logos that are working for them and make yours better!</p>



<h2>Color planning</h2>



<p>If you have decided for a color logo, the colors that you choose will be of vital importance. This is because certain colors evoke particular psychological responses. For example:</p>



<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: 600">RED</span> is a very vibrant, loud colour that evokes passion and drive. It is also considered youthful.</p>



<p><span style="color: orange; font-weight: 600">ORANGE</span> is bright, cheerful and energetic.</p>



<p><span style="color: yellow; font-weight: 600">YELLOW</span> is often thought of as youthful too, as well being seen as accessible, friendly and open.</p>



<p><span style="color: green; font-weight: 600">GREEN</span> is perfect for brands that have some connection to nature, sustainability or the environment. It is considered very versatile and neutral.</p>



<p><span style="color: blue; font-weight: 600">BLUE</span> is often thought of as a safe and classic choice. For many people it evokes security, stability and trust. </p>



<p><span style="color: purple; font-weight: 600">PURPLE</span> is associated with luxury, high-end products and services.</p>



<p><span style="color: pink; font-weight: 600">PINK</span> tends to be thought of as feminine, youthful and excited.</p>



<p><span style="color: brown; font-weight: 600">BROWN</span> logos are often used for masculine, vintage or natural brands.</p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-weight: 600">BLACK</span> is the most direct logo colour, implying that you take your business very seriously. Greys and whites also tend to invoke the same senses of a calm, cool, balanced brand.</p>



<p>Obviously, you may not want to stick to purely one colour. If this is the case, you will need to be conscious of what colours you use together. Fortunately, there are some great online tools that you can use to help you visualize your proposed color scheme, including <a href="https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF" title="paletton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">paletton</a> and <a href="https://coolors.co/" title="coolors" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">coolors</a>. </p>



<h2>Think typography</h2>



<p>Typography – the font/typeface that you use for letters or words in your logo, is equally as important. You need to choose a font that is easy to read at various distances – not much is more awkward than a logo that reads like something it shouldn’t. There are several basic typographies that are most commonly used. These are:</p>



<h3>Serif style</h3>



<p>Often considered the oldest style, these are most commonly used in printed copy, luxury brands and classic logos. However, within the serif style, there are some types that are more vintage and others that are more modern. Common serif style typography choices include:</p>



<ul><li style="font-family: 'Sorts Mill Goudy', serif;">Goudy old style</li><li style="font-family: 'Libre Baskerville', serif;">Baskerville</li><li style="font-family: 'times new roman times', serif;">Time New Roman</li><li style="font-family: 'Bodoni MT',Didot,Didot LT STD,Hoefler Text,Garamond,Times New Roman,serif;">Bodoni</li><li style="font-family: 'Rockwell';">Rockwell</li></ul>



<h3>Sans-serif style</h3>



<p>These fonts are most commonly used in text on computer screens, but in print, they are popular as headlines. They are associated with modernity and minimalism and work particularly well in the simplest logos. They include:</p>



<ul><li style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', sans-serif;">Gill Sans</li><li style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Verdana</li><li style="font-family: Futura,Trebuchet MS,Arial,sans-serif;">Futura</li></ul>



<h3>Script style</h3>



<p>Derived from handwriting, these fluid styles are considered to help ‘humanize’ text and have lots of personality. Their design means that they are best suited to short-form, but large font sizing is usually needed to ensure their legibility. Styles include:</p>



<ul><li style="font-family: Brush Script MT,cursive;">Brush Script</li><li style="font-family: Marck Script;">Script</li><li style="font-family: 'Lucida Calligraphy';">Lucida Calligraphy</li></ul>



<h3>Get designing</h3>



<p>Now you have all of the tools in place, it is time to get designing your new logo. Some brands choose to outsource this process, giving all of their ideas and goals to a professional designer who will create them some options to choose between. However, many businesses prefer to keep the process in-house if they have someone with the skills to create the logo. </p>



<p>Your logo will be a key identifying feature of your business, so you need to be sure that it stands out. The tips and tools above will help you to build a logo and brand that you can feel confident in. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since launching in 1994, Amazon has grown from its humble, book-only, beginnings into a <span id="more-25183"></span>

global marketplace that has become the perfect gateway for businesses looking to sell in the online space. </p>
<p>The popularity of the platform is such, that retailers are benefitting from Amazon’s worldwide brand recognition to market their products to potentially millions of customers. </p>
<p>With dedicated marketplaces in 11 countries, and a customer base from nearly 200, there has never been a better time for businesses to take the leap into eCommerce retailing, than now with Amazon. </p>
<p>On this blog, we’ll run you through some of the key reasons why you should consider selling on the Amazon marketplace, if you haven’t already, to hike up your sales.</p> 
<h2>Market Share </h2>
<p>As mentioned at the top, in addition to its 11 global marketplaces, Amazon currently boasts a customer base from nearly 200 countries. Compare its net revenue in 2016 at 135.99 billion U.S dollars to its closest competitor, eBay, at 8.98 billion U.S dollars, and it becomes abundantly clear just how large a market share Amazon holds on the eCommerce industry. </p>
<p>The platform’s year-over-year revenue growth also sits at 27%, indicating that this significant lead over its competitors is unlikely to change anytime soon, and is bolstered by its recent expansion into countries such as India and Australia.  
More specifically however, Amazon’s active user base sits at over 310 million, nearly doubling that of eBay (168 million), and certainly dwarfing that of other eCommerce applications. The online versus in-store debate is a significant one to have (although at Hike our position is clear – <a href="../../../5-key-differences-between-traditional-commerce-and-e-commerce/index.html" target="_blank">go omnichannel!</a>)  but considering the reach Amazon gives retailers, the choice to sell on its marketplace should be an easy one. </p> 
<h2>Brand Retention</h2>
<p>Whilst it’s significant to have the lion share of customers, where Amazon really thrives is in its ability to keep users logged on and searching for products to buy. </p>
<p>A recent survey, showed that more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-09-27/more-than-50-of-shoppers-turn-first-to-amazon-in-product-search" target="_blank">50% of shoppers use Amazon</a> as their first point of call when it comes to online shopping. We often acknowledge the message of ‘repeat business’ as being key to running a successful store, which is why selling on Amazon is so appealing.</p> 
<p>Given the popularity of Amazon’s services, you can be confident that as a retailer your products will find an online audience, and be doing so in a service that has a proven track record of keeping customers glued onto their website.</p> 
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Among other things Amazon also sets itself apart by being an intuitive and expansive website that has been designed with the modern consumer and aesthetic in mind. </p>
<p>It’s product reviews and seller ratings are not just luxury add-ons but important features that have strengthened the Amazon brand to become what it is today. Even more pertinently, Amazon makes it easy for customers to search for products, as it encourages its sellers to use long titles, product descriptions and keywords. It all adds up to why Amazon is considered as the online marketplace for millions of users around the world.</p>  
<p>Moreover, it’s mobile app gives shoppers the chance to shop anytime, anywhere, and its range of hardware devices like the Echo and Kindle have made it become ecosystems of customers and retailers alike want to be a part of. </p>
<h2>The Amazon Domain</h2>
<p>As mentioned, Amazon gives retailers freedom in being able to market their products on the marketplace with lengthy details and keywords. It’s a great way to ensure a customer get’s a specific result to a specific search.</p> 
<p>More than that however, Amazon is also quite useful for customers that don’t use the site as their first point of call when shopping online. This is because Google’s search algorithms, places a high value on the Amazon domain. So anytime someone searches for a product online, any Amazon listings with said product, will appear at the top of Google’s search results.</p> 
<p>In many instances, retailers will find that they receive more online traffic from customers buying their products through the Amazon marketplace, than their own online website, simply because of Amazon’s ranking in Google’s search algorithms. </p>
<h2>Seamless Service</h2>
<p>In providing one of the better service platforms, retailers can be assured that the bulk of their workload is covered by Amazon. This is primarily seen with the Fulfillment by Amazon program, which enables sellers to send their inventory to an Amazon warehouse, who will then ship the products to the buying customer. </p>
<p>All shipping notifications, customer service enquiries, cancellations and returns are done directly through the Fulfillment by Amazon program, with you having to go anywhere near the goods directly. It’s this type of service that sets Amazon apart from its competitors, and enables retailers to focus more of their time and energy developing other aspects of the business. </p>
<p>Amazon does also set strict regulations on the timeliness and interactions you have with regards to sending out deliveries to the fulfillment centres and that you have prepared your products so that they are ‘e-Commerce’ ready. Metrics that can be viewed on your Seller Central Dashboard. Yet, you’ll find that this level of two-way partnership is exactly what’s needed to operate in a high-performing manner.</p>
<h2>Forefront of Innovation</h2> 
<p>When talking about the retail space in 2018, inevitably Amazon is a name that everyone will eventually circle back to. Its story is legendary, and considered a success in American intuition, but what has fuelled its growth and longevity hasn’t been simply just one idea.</p> 
<p>Rather, it’s been Amazon’s commitment to developing and nurturing new ideas that has it at the forefront for retail innovation. It doesn’t simply wait for customers to ask for something, but instead sets the agenda itself and points its customers in its direction.</p> 
<p>Whether we’re talking about Amazon Prime, Alexa, Amazon Go Supermarkets or Drone Delivery, the world is not only waiting for the company’s latest invention, but are ready to actively embrace it. </p>
<p>Therefore, Amazon makes a perfect match for retailers that wish to grow their business online. Its resources are plentiful, it’s innovation continually game-changing, but also perhaps most significantly, its established platform and customer base is the envy of all else. </p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../why-you-should-start-selling-on-amazon-today/index.html">Why you should start selling on Amazon today</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 data-teal-gradient-color="teal-gradient-color">Marketing gift cards to your customers</h2><hr class="hike nomargin">
<p class="margintop">As retailers (and shoppers), we’re no stranger to the power of gift cards. They are the best present you can give someone <span id="more-24702"></span>

whilst simultaneously acting as a terrific marketing tool, that’s designed to bring in new customers in lieu of repeat business. </p>
<p>Indeed, that word, ‘repeat businesses’, should perk up the ears of any retailer looking to increase sales and revenue, and which is why gift cards play such a significant part in achieving that goal. As such, understanding just how to best market and sell gift cards to your customers should be thought of as retail 101. </p>
<p>In this article, we’ll run through just some of the ways in which retailers can market gift cards to their customers, improving your sales reach and potentially unleashing a swarm of new business. </p>
<h2>Assertively market gift cards</h2>
<p>It’s common for some retailers to employ a wait until asked approach on gift cards. They won’t actively market them to shoppers and will only perform a sale of one when asked. This is decidedly a poor way in which to utilise gift cards as in this scenario they are simply treated as an after-thought, rather than as an integral part of your product line. </p>
<p>Retailers should instead take an assertive approach when it comes to marketing gift-cards, actively asking customers if they would like to purchase one during the checkout process. Whilst there are more visually representative methods to promote the existence of gift cards (more on that later), selling to a customer’s face is the most direct way of doing so. </p>
<p>This should be emphasised to your sales staff as well, as they are the ones who will most often be delivering this message. </p>
<h2>Visually present your gift cards in-store</h2>
<p>The plastic shell of a gift card will probably not be the most attention-grabbing item in your store, but like anything, great placement will attract the eye of the consumer.  For this you’ll want to have your gift-cards displayed on a rack or shelf at the highest traffic area/s inside your store. </p>
<p>For many this will be the checkout counter, where you’ll be able to have gift cards displayed directly next to your POS system – providing your staff the perfect opportunity in which they can also sell it to a customer. </p>
<p>Moreover, whilst your plastic gift cards can appear visually stale, it’s easy to add a bit of character and personalisation for that added bit of spunk. Run a pet store? Well how about a customised dog bone as your gift card, instead of the just another credit-sized card. Head to your local printing shop to see what options are available to you and your store, to jazz up your gift cards and grab the attention of your customers. </p>
<h2>Market outside your store’s demographics</h2>
<p>At the top of this article we mentioned how gift cards are really the perfect present. However, when marketing gift cards to customers, you need to expand the range of people you market to, to not only be selling to your own customers. Simply put, this means that you also need to target people who would buy a gift card for someone else. </p>
<p>This requires a shift in thinking, where you consider more lateral options of customer bases that don’t necessarily reflect the demographics of those that shop in your store, but are connected to people that do. </p>
<p>For example, if your business consists of women’s clothing, perhaps targeting men, or more specifically husbands, would be worth the investment in spending your marketing dollars on. The same would obviously apply to men’s stores and targeting to wives. After all, who hasn’t been stumped at what to get for that special someone, and advertising the gift card at exactly the right time could just be the lifesaver he or she needs. </p>
<h2>Cross-business promotion</h2>
<p>To expand the reach of gift card appeal you can try contacting other businesses and get them to have your cards displayed in their store. This will most likely involve an exchange of cards in some form, where they will market your gift cards if you do the same with theirs. </p>
<p>Finding stores that complement your own, would be a good way in which to navigate a more interested customer as well, and even if a gift card is not purchased they may be tempted to take a visit to your store. Finding your gift cards a home in local or regional grocery stores, alongside other gift cards, would also be a boon to business. However, you should only go down that route if it makes financial sense for your business, as they are likely to take a percentage out of your sales. </p>
<h2>Gift cards for events</h2>
<p>Hallmark sells cards for birthdays, Father’s and Mother’s Day, Valentine’s Day etc, so why not attempt the same for gift cards? This goes to the personalisation aspect that you should already consider employing, but having holiday specific can give your gift cards a sense of variety that your customers will love. </p>
<p>With Valentine’s Day just around the corner, it makes brilliant marketing sense to create theme product displays involving your most ‘Valentine Day’ appropriate items, with gift cards packaged front and centre.  </p>
<h2>Online and social media marketing</h2>
<p>The most permanent way in which to market gift cards is through your online platforms with social media and your online and/or e-Commerce website. This increases the awareness your shoppers have of your gift cards and doesn’t just limit yourself to marketing in-store. </p>
<p>Social media presents an opportunity to market gift cards by putting up posts that illustrate your gift-card design (particularly useful if you’ve gone the personalised card route). Periodically, and around holiday events, you can post messages stating that you have gift cards available for anyone needing a ‘last minute’ present. </p>
<p>Your online website and/or e-Commerce page should also directly have an option to purchase gift cards, or at least that you are selling them. Banners, splashed across your front page during those holiday seasons are also useful in letting your customers know that you’re selling them. </p>
<p>Establishing the importance of the gift card is inherently important, but so too is the need to actively market them. Whilst there are many cost-effective ways in which to do so, the most important factor when marketing gift cards to your customers is to get out and do so. </p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../marketing-gift-cards-to-your-customers/index.html">Marketing gift cards to your customers</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As retail habits change and evolve, so too has the retailer’s need for a robust point-of-sale solution. Such is the necessity of having a system <span id="more-24523"></span>

that can do everything that without one, retailers are starting to wear the brunt of it, as seen in their bottom line. </p>
<p>Within that ‘everything’ schematic then, is a point-of-sale that includes a sales and inventory tracker that updates the most pertinent aspects of a business in real-time. </p>
<p>Certainly, the retail industry is not far removed from the pen and paper days of inventory management and sales recording, but the advent of the online POS system has made the increasingly complex process, turn into something streamlined and accessible for everyone to use.  </p>
<p>Indeed, the growth of POS terminals that track inventory and sales has become so pronounced in today’s world because of how the industry has matured, especially in recent years. </p>
<p>Consider the popularity of non-cash transactions like PayPal and Apple Pay, and the online e-Commerce juggernaut that has brought growth to so many businesses around the world.  These are new additions to the retail industry that make old methods of counting stock obsolete, and why the retail POS Terminal market size is forecasted to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/retail-pos-terminals-market-to-hit-45bn-by-2024-global-market-insights-inc-611042605.html" target="_blank">surpass $45 billion</a> in 2024.  </p>
<h2>Efficiency: Saving time, saving money</h2>
<p>Championing the need for one point-of-sale system that can do many different things are obviously easy enough to understand, but to grasp it in terms of sales and inventory requires context. </p>
<p>Say you’re performing a sale – 3 jackets and 2 pairs of jeans – at your clothing retail store. A potent POS, will then automatically adjust your inventory counts for those two stock items, whilst allowing you to conduct the transaction to your customer, without you having to do anything.</p>
<p>This is where the need for a POS system is most significant as it is used to simultaneously track sales and inventory in real-time. The added benefits of time saved and efficient software book-keeping to a business is priceless. And of course, this doesn’t just have to be sales and inventory but even your customer data – if you add one to a sale – which can be recorded as well. </p>
<p>Moreover, in having one system performing all these functions, the need to have multiple record-keeping processes, potentially doubling your costs, is eliminated. Save time, and save money by utilising a point-of-sale system that does it all. </p>
<p class="highlight">Hike Tip: As Hike POS is an omnichannel POS solution, everything from your inventory to your sales orders and customer data, is connected under the one, centrally located system. All aspects of your store operations are updated in real-time, across all your various platforms. </p>
<h2>Optimizing inventory management</h2>
<p>Looking at the inventory management part of your POS, a sophisticated system can go beyond just the counting of stock that enters and leaves your store. It can ensure that your business operations are always on top of your most pressing needs, in a way that’s not intrusive. </p>
<p>For example, Hike POS gives retailers the option to set:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Automated Re-Order Reminders: Set re-order points on your products, to remind you when inventory is about to run low. These can be customised for any product, so you adjust the points in the way they are suitable for the item (e.g. order more stock for best-selling items). When the product hits the re-order level, you will receive an automated reminder. </li>
<li>Bulk Import, Export &#038; Edit: The export and import function in Hike lets you add, update and count thousands of inventory items at once. Apply important cost price updates or other information without delay.</li> 
<li>Inventory Counting: Whether you choose to do cyclical or full inventory counts, Hike makes the job a painless one. Schedule counts in advance, and even action multiple partial counts at once. With a barcode scanner, all it takes is a simple point and click for your count to get started. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Confidence in extra security</h2>
<p>With important features like sales and inventory, it makes sense to want to ensure that all your data is safely secured. Given the functionality, a smart POS system is likely to be cloud-based, so it makes sense to want to know how your sales and inventory data is protected. </p>
<p>Whilst we can’t speak for other POS system, Hike POS employs password protected logins to all staff that will be using the system. Admins (Business Owners) can even set individual user privileges, meaning that certain staff will only be able to access the parts of Hike that are relevant to their role. This is not to mention the fact that as a <a href="../../../../cloud-pos/index.html">cloud</a> service, your entire inventory and sales data is available to you at anytime, anywhere, regardless of your presence in-store. With complete, and customisable reporting, any transaction, and stock movement will be immediately known to you. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Hike POS is hosted by Amazon <a href="../../../../web-based-pos/index.html">Web</a> Services (AWS), which is ISO 27001 certified. AWS data centres are secured with biometric, 24-hour surveillance and 24-7 onsite staff, that protects against unauthorized entry. Indeed, modern technology has also given rise to modern security threats, so to have the ease of a secure system, will certainly alleviate one of the pressing issues any POS retailer may face. </p>
<p>It’s common for nostalgia to arise amongst older generations, who can feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of modern technology, and it how it has changed processes. </p>
<p>However, one thing that we can be relatively confident in is that technology has dramatically improved the way retailers conduct things like performing a sale and managing their inventory. Having a POS system that does those things, are of essential importance in today’s retail age and one that businesses simply can’t afford to live without. </p>
<p>That being said, it’s important to try and test the POS that a) fits your requirements, and b) is easy to use. We touched on it previously, but having a thorough reporting and analytics tool on your sales and inventory, can be just the thing you need to improve your business and make better business decisions.  </p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../inventory-and-sales/index.html">Inventory &#038; sales</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The art of crafting the perfect email is no easy feat.</p>
<p>Whether you’re wondering if you haven’t clearly made your point to worrying if you’ve committed an accidental <span id="more-21477"></span>

faux pas, the nerves a person can face after sending an email is very real (and perfectly normal!).</p>
<p>To alleviate some of those pressures, we’ve compiled several of our favorite tips &amp; tricks to help you write emails that not only sound great but gets you the responses you’re after.</p>
<h2>Short &amp; Sweet</h2>
<p>Whilst deep down we all probably see ourselves as the next Stephen King or Jane Austen, writing emails isn’t a medium for us to write the next Pulitzer winning novel. Long narratives and descriptive imagery is certainly not required and our most pertinent piece of information shouldn’t come at the end.</p>
<p>Instead, the best way to approach an email is <strong>short &amp; sweet</strong>, getting out the relevant information right away with the five W’s (who, what were, when and why) being featured prominently. In fact, the best way to think about writing an email might be as a news journalist.</p>
<p>Keep the juicy information at the top, and <strong>don’t bury the lede!</strong> Write an email where you know the reader won’t be bored by needless information. The aim here is to ensure you’ve got their attention and can keep it. If you’ve finished an email, and notice that it is quite long even after a trim, perhaps consider how you deliver that message – perhaps its best suited as a phone call?</p>
<h2>Insert: Unambiguous subject line</h2>
<p>A preamble to the short and sweet email however, is of course the <strong>subject line</strong>. It’s amazing to think that some people might spend more time crafting the perfect subject line than they do writing the actual email, but such is the importance placed on the line that it’s imperative that it’s done right.</p>
<p>Again though, the answer is to keep compose a few words or a short sentence that accurately relays the purpose and urgency of the email.  In various instances, you might want to consider writing a subject line that contains the objective. For example, if you’re emailing a coworker about getting a coffee, your subject line might read ‘Let’s grab a coffee?’</p>
<p>Or if it’s an action that you need the other person to complete – such as signing a document or making a decision &#8211; you should write that action in the subject line as well. Know who your emailing to as well, in the sense of whether you can be informal to a close work colleague compared to keeping it professional with a client.</p>
<h2>Review, Review, Review!!!</h2>
<p>It’s important to review any type of work to you do, but especially in emails – because there’s no take-backs! Don’t fall into the trap of getting hooked to a stream of consciousness that sounds so great, that you feel confident enough to not read over before you hit SEND.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, to go over your email is invaluable for several reasons; one it enables you to proofread your work more thoroughly. Spell-checks are convenient, but they don’t always account for phrasing, or typos.
</p>
<p>But more importantly, reviews can give you the time you need to make sure your work <strong>makes sense</strong>. There’s nothing worse than sending an email, only to get a reply asking for clarification. As per our short &amp; sweet ethos, make sure your email cuts directly to the point, <strong>no unnecessary words</strong> and is understandable, not just to you but the person you are sending it to.</p>
<h2>Keep it Clean</h2>
<p>This may seem self-explanatory but it’s often been the cause for significant workplace problems. Aside from the usual language warnings, to judge the cleanliness of your email, you should first ask yourself if you would be comfortable if anyone else in the organization was to read it.</p>
<p>Voicing a strongly worded opinion of a colleague or robust criticism of a boss, isn’t just a recipe for an awkward workplace environment. It could potentially lead to disciplinary actions and even libel actions. Whether you feel as though your feelings are justified, an email is <strong>not the place to voice them</strong>.</p>
<h2>Be Prompt</h2>
<p>There’s a lot to be said about knowing when to send an email. Getting that quick response may just be a matter of timing, and using that to your advantage can enhance your own productivity.</p>
<p>To that end <a href="http://blog.boomerangapp.com/2016/02/7-tips-for-getting-more-responses-to-your-emails-with-data/">research has shown</a> that most people check their emails during the morning 8am-10am period, Tuesday-Friday. This of course make sense, when you consider most people will check their emails at their desk, when they arrive in the morning. Sending your message at that time is a great way to increase your chances of getting prompt reply.</p>
<p>However, avoid sending emails during off-hours. Where mobile technology has given people the convenience of 24/7 email connectivity, responding to emails on weekends and late at night, might not illicit a quick response. You could send an email at 6pm on a Saturday to a colleague, who might view it, but not reply and ultimately forget that it even existed once he/she returned to work on Monday.</p>
<p>Avoid, miscommunication by following common sense etiquette, and sending your emails in the morning.</p>
<p>To become inundated with emails to the point of having OCD in needing your inbox to read <strong>zero unread messages</strong> is widespread. Such is our reliance with this form of communication that it becomes easy to fall into the trap of writing emails without checking it for clarity. By keeping these tips in mind, you might just find that the pitfalls you can fall into whilst writing an email, can be avoided.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../craft-the-perfect-work-email/index.html">Guide to crafting the perfect work email</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the biggest marketing opportunities in the modern world comes in the form of popular events. Think the Oscars, the Olympics and the Super Bowl, all televised events that draw huge ratings.<span id="more-9976"></span> For example, an average of 114.4 <em>million</em> Americans tuned in the 2015 Super Bowl. In fact most high-profile events generate the opportunity for brands to get noticed and raise their own profile. In addition to the TV coverage there is the knock on impact of social media to consider. According to Twitter there were 36 million tweets related to the Super Bowl, and they received more than 2.5 <em>billion</em> impressions. Facebook also reported 265 million posts, comments and likes related to the huge event.</p>
<p>With such huge audiences involved it is no surprise that these events throw up some of the biggest and best opportunities for real-time or moment marketing, and brands and businesses across the globe race to get in on the buzz whilst it is happening. Obviously this means making the effort to be following them closely and having your creative head on to maximise on any moment that you can.</p>
<p>Many of the social media conversations surrounding these events go viral, taking advantage of our natural curiosity and desire for gossip. Whether it is the half time show, a celebrity tripping over the hem of their gown or other newsworthy reveal, it gives us something to connect with others about. Even the simplest and subtlest things can make big waves in the social media pond as we search for things to expand on, and in many cases blow completely out of proportion.</p>
<p>By being ready to react when watching these big ticket events, you too can position your brand at the starting blocks of the next big conversation.</p>
<h2>Getting Ready</h2>
<p>Speed really is the name of the game when it comes to reacting to events. Shorter attention spans and more content than ever being available means that the spike of interest you have to make an impression is limited. The biggest weapon in your arsenal is your smartphone. Pre-loaded with Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Periscope, Meme Generator and more helps you to get your posts created quickly. However, speed isn&#8217;t everything and you need to remember that you need to get traction for your content in order for it to count.</p>
<p>This is the occasion where bigger really is better, and the bigger your audience the greater the competitive edge you will have when you are battling for a piece of the spotlight. A bigger audience means more engagement, more retweets and an even bigger audience&#8230; and so on.</p>
<p>So what can you do to make your business stand out from the rest?</p>
<h5>Be Quick</h5>
<p>One of the best examples we have seen of a quickly devised marketing tweet has to come from Oreo. Their famous You can still dunk in the dark tweet, made famous during the Super Bowl blackout in 2013, took less than 34 minutes from concept to publishing and earned more than 15,000 retweets.</p>
<h5>Stay aligned with your brand</h5>
<p>There have been a number of horrendous occasions where companies or organisations have tried to immerse themselves in a conversation that really hasn&#8217;t had anything to do with their brand or values.</p>
<p>Similarly, take the example of the costume shark character who upstaged Katy Perry during her half time performance at the Super Bowl sufficiently enough to earn 284,000 tweets per minute about it. PETA chose to jump on this bandwagon and created a tweet of their own with the tagline PROOF u DON&#8217;T need real animals to amaze a crowd. Whilst the tweet got quite a lot of engagement, it also turned off some people who weren&#8217;t part of PETA&#8217;s audience.</p>
<h5>Be Funny</h5>
<p>Humour is one sure way of getting yourself noticed, and great humour can win you love and earn you a following. It is also a great way of inserting your brand or organisation into a conversation without coming across as pushy or overbearing.</p>
<p>A fantastic example we have seen is when Arby&#8217;s, famous for their burgers, took advantage of the shape of singer/rapper Pharrell&#8217;s hat he wore at the Grammy&#8217;s&#8230; because it was identical in shape to the Arby&#8217;s logo. Their tweet,Hey @Pharrell, can we have our hat back hashtagged #Grammys generated a whole heap of retweets purely because it was funny.</p>
<p>Humour also gets brands interacting with one another as proven when Quaker joined the conversation with a similarly humorous tweet. As long as you&#8217;ve got your website linked to your profile and your bio describes what you&#8217;re about then there is no need to do any pushy selling. Humour is also ultra-shareable on social media meaning you can get maximum exposure for quite minimal input.</p>
<h5>Get Live</h5>
<p>Live tweeting, streaming and posting under your brand name is one of the best ways of interacting with people who may be interested in your product or service. Best of all it is effective regardless of the scale of the event, although being able to live tweet about an event in your niche will put you within reach of people who will be much more relevant to your brand.</p>
<p>Hashtag usage is another powerful tool that can be used in conjunction with live tweeting as they extend your reach, give your audience something to follow along with and make your conversations easy to find. Twitter polls allow you to enhance this even further by letting you get feedback from others who are following the hashtags and engage with them in a more productive and interactive way.</p>
<p>If you want to get really clever, consider using Hootsuite for live tweeting, which allows you monitor multiple hashtags or profiles on different channels, but all on one easy to navigate dashboard. This will increase your capacity to engage with more conversations in real-time than your average social media user.</p>
<h5>Be Prepared</h5>
<p>Just like a boy scout, it pays to be prepared for big-noise events such as award ceremonies and big sporting events. Most of these opportunities are on the calendar well in advance and if there are clever marketing images or catchy slogans that you think you can create beforehand then it could be well worth the time and effort.</p>
<p>Make sure you keep the evening clear to watch and monitor trending social media, being in the right place at the right time could be a real time marketing goldmine!oH</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../tips-for-real-time-marketing-with-social-media/index.html">Tips for Real-time marketing with social media</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

<p>The first thing that you need to do it to create a personal Google+ profile and a Google+ page for your business if you haven&#8217;t already.<em> We have put together these screenshots to help you with the process.</em></p>
<ol>
 	<li>Once you have logged into your Google+ account, head over the YouTube Channel Switcher. Your personal account should be visible as well as the option to create a new account for your Google+ page.</li>
 	<li>Click on your business page. A pop-up will appear asking you to confirm that you would like to create a channel for your business. Click &#8216;<strong>OK&#8217;</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Another pop-up will appear to tell you that your YouTube channel and Google+ page will be connected. Click &#8216;<strong>OK&#8217; </strong>again.</li>
 	<li>Ta-da! It&#8217;s that simple. You are now the owner of a YouTube business channel!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Customizing your YouTube channel</h2>
<p>Customization is an important part of creating a professional channel that aligns with your brand identity. It also makes it easier for your customers to find you which is vital for it to be successful.</p>
<h3>Channel icon</h3>
<p>Your channel icon is automatically linked to your Google+ profile picture. Make sure that your channel icon is an image that is easily identified as your business; usually your logo or business name is best. Your image should be uploaded as a JPG, BMP, PNG or non-animated GIF and be at least 800&#215;800 pixels.</p>
<h3>Channel artwork</h3>
<p>Personalization of your channel artwork is an easy way to add vibrancy and personality to your YouTube profile. Make sure that it fits with your branding and is interesting enough to engage with your audience. Your channel artwork should be under 4MB and YouTube recommends it to be at least 2560&#215;1440 pixels for optimum results.</p>
<h3>Description and Details</h3>
<p>Customizing your description and details gives you the opportunity to explain exactly what your business is and what it can offer customers. Short, concise snippets with minimal jargon are ideal.</p>
<p><em>To unlock the customization options for your channel you will need to click the gear icon in the section beneath your channel art.</em></p>
<ol>
 	<li>A pop-up titled &#8216;Channel settings&#8217; will appear. Look for the option to &#8216;customize the layout of your channel&#8217; and enable it. Then click &#8216;<strong>Save&#8217;</strong>. You will then get a wider range of options sorted into five different tabs: Home; Videos; Playlists; Channels and About. Select the &#8216;<strong>About&#8217;</strong> tab to edit the details of your business.</li>
 	<li>Under &#8216;Description&#8217; give a brief outline of your business, your products/service and your mission. Be sure to also include your contact email so that your customers can get in touch! Also make sure that you include all of your business&#8217; social media links, which you can get to appear over your channel artwork by adjusting the drop down menu.</li>
 	<li>On the right hand side you will find a section titled &#8216;Featured Channels&#8217; where you can feature other YouTube channels that are owned by your brand or managed by your employees. While this section may not be useful to you yet, once you expand your YouTube presence you may wish to diversify into other channels.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Creating kick-ass Content!</h3>
<p>The best content online does one of three things – entertains, educates or it is useful, and the very best content combines at least two of these elements. The opportunity to include video in your business marketing strategy is a no-brainer. High quality videos provide visual stimulation that engages with your audience and gets them liking and more importantly, sharing your content across the social stage.</p>
<p>So what kind of content could your business be using?</p>
<h3>Educational Content</h3>
<p>Long gone are the days when you had to look in a book to learn something new. An increasing number of people are now using the internet to expand their knowledge and searches for ‘how to’ videos are growing at an incredible 70% year on year. Adding an educational spin on your videos can help to intrigue and captivate audiences and help you build a trusting relationship. People also learn better through visual aid so you will actually be providing a high quality educational experience, adding value to your brand.</p>
<p>One of the best examples of this that we have seen recently has been provided by HP. Searching ‘how to change ink cartridge HP deskjet’ on YouTube, the first video in the list was one created by HP that explained the process step by step.</p>
<p>This is a great tactical manoeuvre by HP who by creating this simple guide have provided the solution to a common problem and answered some frequently asked questions. HP has also expanded on this strategy by creating a wide range of videos that address a multitude of issues from setting up tutorials to troubleshooting, which they have uploaded to their HP Printer Support channel on YouTube.</p>
<p>Another great example of great YouTube business content comes from Luxy Hair, which is an ecommerce hair extension store that built their brand from scratch on YouTube. They have a huge range of tutorials on their channel that they use to provide braid demonstrations, styling tips and more.</p>
<p>This video, showing quick and easy hairstyles for busy mornings, has had more than 14 million hits and is one of their most viewed pieces of content. Luxy Hair now has a community of over 2.5 million subscribers thanks to their strategy of providing inspirational and educational content.</p>
<p>Whilst showcasing their products, their strategy also focuses on illustrating how their current customers can get the most enjoyment from their hair extensions. This approach subtly blends content and advertising.</p>
<h3>Brand Storytelling</h3>
<p>Storytelling is one of the most powerful ways of conveying messages and many businesses use their ‘About Us’ page to tell customers the journey of how they started and have developed. However instead of or as well as using text, you can use a compelling video to describe your brand identity, mission and values.</p>
<p>Evolving customer demands; particularly among millennial’s has seen increasing value being placed on experiential rather than material purchases. Therefore when sharing brand storytelling videos you should aim to illustrate a lifestyle that customers can aspire to that is in sync with your brand. This creates the feeling of buying into a complete experience rather than a singular product or service.</p>
<p>A cracking example is the YouTube content posted by GoPro action cameras. Their dynamic videos feature adventure, adrenaline and exploration which are synonymous with the GoPro brand, and demonstrate the many different ways in which their products can be used. They are also directed in such a way that they embody the GoPro tagline, <strong>‘Be a Hero’</strong>.</p>
<h3>Entertainment</h3>
<p>Ever wonder why a video of a skateboarding kitten has racked up hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube? It is a natural instinct to want to be entertained see things that we have never seen before.</p>
<p>There are some extremely clever and subtle videos out there that combine entertainment and embedded marketing to create truly compelling content that gets shared over and over.</p>
<p>Vat19, an ecommerce gift shop that has a special interest in unusual, offbeat products, has built a serious YouTube following (currently more than 2 million subscribers!) thanks to a creative and highly targeted marketing strategy. Their approach is to use absurd comedy sketches around their extensive selection of novelty gifts in order to introduce new products to their audience.</p>
<p>One of their most popular videos features a 5lb gummy bear being destroyed in a range of slapstick experiments that are more akin to late night comedy than advertising. The strategy is clearly paying off for Vat19 as the gummy bear video has been viewed more than 25 million times, proving that entertaining content really does attract significant attention.</p>
<h3>Optimizing your videos for search engines</h3>
<p>You could be forgiven for thinking SEO doesn’t matter when it comes to YouTube videos, but you couldn’t be more wrong. Getting your SEO right is vital if you want to get your videos noticed, and everything from the title to the description can help get your video searchable and stand out from the other 400+ hours of video that are uploaded every minute.</p>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<p>Keywords are exactly what their name suggests – key words that people search for when looking for things on the internet. A vital part of your SEO strategy will involve working out which keywords people might use when they are searching for your video and there is a nifty little keyword tool for YouTube that you use to make sure that you have chosen popular search terms.</p>
<p>Understanding and utilizing popular search terms is crucial to building successful future content, and this may involve some trial and error on your part.</p>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>The actual format of your video is also important when it comes to your overall search ranking, but there are some considerations that can help you climb your way up the results page. These include:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Filename. Your target keywords should be in the name of the file that you are uploading.</li>
 	<li>Title. The title of your video should feature your target keyword near the start and be as clear and concise as possible.</li>
 	<li>Length. When it comes to YouTube video files, bigger is usually considered better.</li>
 	<li>Description. Again, bigger is better and your description should be high quality and keyword rich.</li>
 	<li>Tags. Target keywords and associated terms should feature in your video tags.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Engagement</h3>
<p>Engagement is one of the biggest things that the powers behind YouTube take into consideration when determining the quality of your video. Encouraging customer interaction using the ‘thumbs up’ button and subscribing to video channels helps to forge stronger relationships with customers and encourages them to return time after time.</p>
<p>When YouTube ranks your video it will almost certainly take your video’s view count into consideration so get networking!</p>
<h3>Simple YouTube Hacks</h3>
<p>Once you have got to grips with the basics of YouTube for business, you may wish to explore some of the more complex functions that can help drive new subscribers and plenty more traffic. These include&#8230;</p>
<h3>Adding a Watermark</h3>
<p>Watermarks are customizable online ‘stamps’ that differentiate your images from stock. It gets overlaid on every image that you upload making it easy to identify which are from you, and links back to your Channel which will encourage your audience to subscribe.</p>
<ol>
 	<li>To add a watermark to your videos find your channel page and click on <strong>‘Video Manager’</strong>. This will then take you to the Creator Studio where you can access some of the deeper level settings for your account.</li>
 	<li>Once you get to the Creator Studio, click on <strong>‘Channel’</strong> in the sidebar. A drop-down will appear under <strong>‘Channel’</strong>. Click on <strong>‘Branding’</strong> and then <strong>‘Add Watermark’</strong>, and you will then be able to upload an image that will show up in the corner of all of your videos.
Whenever you provide a link to your channel, add ‘?sub¬¬_confirmation=1’ to the end of your channel’s URL and pop-up asking people to subscribe will appear on your site.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Interactive Purchases</h3>
<p>You’ve seen a YouTube video with a product that is so awesome that we want to purchase it there and then. Well by linking Merch cards to your website you will be able to take card payments for items that customers have seen on your website at the touch of a button.</p>
<p>If you want to add merch cards to your videos just head over to your Video Manager and click on ‘Edit’ for the video that you would like to add a card to. At the top of your screen several tabs will appear. Click on ‘Cards’ followed by’Link Cards’ and then add in the information for your products.</p>
<p>As this article has demonstrated, there are plenty of ways in which you can utilize YouTube to grow your business even further. Keeping pace with technology, creating kick ass content and building a strong social presence can help to propel your business firmly skyward throughout and beyond 2016.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../how-to-start-a-youtube-channel-for-your-small-business/index.html">How to start a YouTube channel for your small business</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In business today, having a great product is just not enough. You need to have a great brand too. Strong branding is vital because it tells your customers <span id="more-8353"></span>

what to expect from both your products and services. It tells them what kind of company you are and what you strive to be, and finally, it makes you stand out from your competitors.</p>
<p>You cannot be all things to all customers and the key to great branding is to decide who you are and stick to it. Are you an established, reliable and experienced brand or fresh, innovative and new but determined?</p>
<p>However, at the very foundation of your brand is your company logo.</p>
<h2>Why is a logo so important?</h2>
<p>Logos are vital to any successful business. With the brain being able to process images far quicker than text, a logo is a visual representation of your brand, the ‘face’ of your business, and if done well should be recognizable almost instantly.</p>
<p>They are an ideal tool for promoting your brand across all of your business platforms. From eCommerce to business cards, emails to store displays, customers should be able to make an immediate connection between your logo and your brand. If these are satisfied customers (and let’s face it, hopefully they are!) it will also invoke feelings of trust, loyalty and great customer service.</p>
<p>We understand that most Start-Ups are on a budget, and whilst creating a legendary logo needs to be high up on the priority list, it doesn’t have to break the bank. There are a number of fantastic, quality logo generators available online and in this blog post we are going to share with you our favorite ones.</p>
<p>But first, here are our top tips to creating a successful logo that will compliment your brand identity.</p>
<p>Keep it simple<em> – </em>a small quirk or unique take on an otherwise traditional layout are sometimes all it takes to make a logo stand out. You need something easily recognizable both at thumbnail and billboard size so don’t overdraw it!</p>
<p>Think about your target audience<em> – </em>you need to ensure that the logo you design is appropriate for the audience it is intended for. For example, bright primary colors may work well for a kid’s retail store, but will look unprofessional for a medical manufacturer or accountancy firm.</p>
<p>Make it memorable<em> – </em>you need customers to immediately make the connection between your logo and your brand. If they fail to remember that detail, they will fail to remember your business.</p>
<p>Longevity is vital<em> – </em>you don’t want to have to change your logo because it becomes ineffective or looks dated a few years down the line. A great example of a future-proofed logo is Coca-Cola which has remained the same for over 100 years. By comparison, its nearest competitor, Pepsi, has made numerous changes to its logo in the same period of time.</p>
<p>Color-proof it<em> – </em>make sure that your logo looks just as effective in black and white as in color.</p>
<p>Avoid Clip Art<em> – </em>A logo created using Clip Art images looks cheap and lazy – two characteristics you do <em>not</em> want your business to be associated with!</p>
<p>So now, here are five of our favorite online logo creators.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.logoshi.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Logoshi</a></h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For every business no matter how large or small, publicity is a fantastic way to raise your profile. Not only will this drive increased traffic to your store or website, but it <span id="more-8005"></span>

also gives you the opportunity to tap into a whole new supply of customers. As such, publicity is a highly valuable asset and should be used wisely in order to maximise its positive effects. The possibility of getting your product or service into an article or blog post is exciting, and the more prominent the publication, the more exposure your business will receive.</p>
<p>Another added benefit of publicity is that it adds credibility to your business or brand, as being featured in newspapers, industry magazines or on websites allows you to use their logo on your own website and marketing materials. This kind of ‘social proof’ helps foster trust from potential customers and other people who are not familiar with your business.</p>
<p>Despite all of the positives that come from building relationships with the media, actually getting approached by and written about by these influential publications is not always straightforward. However, it <em>is </em>much more likely if your business has an accessible media kit.</p>
<h2>What is a Media Kit?</h2>
<p>You might be more familiar with the term ‘press kit’, which for many people immediately conjures up images of packs of information detailing company profiles. The actual premise hasn’t changed too much, but as publicity is now available on so much more than just printed press, many businesses are now opting to use the term ‘media kit’ instead.</p>
<p>There are three main goals of any media kit and these are:</p>
<ul>
 	<li>Grab readers attention</li>
 	<li>Make a lasting impression</li>
 	<li>Incite interest that makes the reader want to contact you for more information</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, a media kit is basically a resume for your business, but produced in such a way that if fulfils the same criteria as any other compelling content found online – it is either useful, informative or entertaining – and ideally all three!</p>
<p>Having a media kit on your website makes it far easier for anyone who is interested in your business to find a snapshot of what you are all about. People who may want to write about your business are not necessarily just journalists, but could include bloggers, product reviewers and more. Having an overview of the basic information that they need will help them make a quick and informed decision as to whether or not your business or brand fits the profile that they want to write about. They are significantly more likely to choose to feature a business that has a readily-prepared media kit as this saves them valuable research time.</p>
<p>A business that has such information readily available to anyone that is interested also demonstrates an open and honest company ethos, which reflects well when creating new relationships with clients and other businesses.</p>
<p>When it comes to placing your media kit on your website, the most common location is with smaller company information in the footer rather than in the main navigational bar. You will also have to decide if you wish your media kit to be available as html or a downloadable (and printable) PDF.</p>
<h2>What is needed to create a kick ass media kit?</h2>
<h4>What goes into your media kit is likely to vary depending on the type of business you are in, and what product or service you offer. However, there are a number of things that should be considered to be staple elements of any successful press kit. These include:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>A large, hi-resolution image of your business logo/branding, preferably with a transparent background. A company or brand logo can be one of its key identifying features. Incorporating it into your media kit means that publications can easily use it in any of their material, therefore increasing the profile of your business. If possible, you should also try to include a download of the raw vector file too.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Your business story should be told in no more than three paragraphs. You should explain what inspired your business, what your vision for it was and what continue to drive it. This is also a good time to share any mission statements or influential stages of its development.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Facts and figures are important to the majority of publications, and one of the most popular ways of portraying them is by using infographics. The sort of information that you can share includes how long you have been in business, where your offices are, who your target demographic is etc. The options are limitless, but you should focus on the facts that you think people will be most interested in.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Media kits are often important to investors, so it would also be a good idea to share positive turnover, growth and profit figures if you feel they would be suitable, along with any investor-related news.</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>Team biographies are a great way for people to get to know the brains behind your business. We aren’t talking about every single team member, but chief officers, owners and senior management should definitely get a mention, as should anyone who has a particularly interesting story about how they got involved in your organization. Include photographs of these staff to help humanize your company further.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>If your business has a unique spelling or arrangement of letters/capitalization, then you should definitely specify how you want your company, brand or product names to appear in publications.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li>Finally, if you have examples of other press that you have received you should include them here. These don’t have to just be printed publications, but could also include press releases, interviews, blog posts and links to videos or vlogs. This will be useful to potential publications as they will be able to see where your business has been featured previously and what information was shared.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other optional things that you may wish to include in your media kit could include:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Information about any industry awards or other recognition that your business has received.</li>
 	<li>Details of any non-profit work that your business is involved in, and any charities that you support. If you chose specific charities for a reason, then you may want to share the story behind that reason too.</li>
 	<li>A “what they are saying about us” section gives you the opportunity to share client testimonials or reviews of your product.</li>
 	<li>If you have a separate email address for media enquiries then you should include it here, making sure that you state that you are available for follow up questions or interviews.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Great Media Kit Examples</h2>
<p>Just in case you still aren’t sure what goes into creating a great media kit, listed below are some examples of some organizations that have got the right idea.</p>
<h3><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/advertise">Buzzfeed</a></h3>
<h3><a href="http://luminaid.com/pages/press-kit">LuminAID</a></h3>
<h2>Presenting your Media Kit</h2>
<p>Whilst we have mostly looked at how to create an online media kit, it is important to remember that you should have a printable version available too. Whilst most people are happy to receive and read information online, there will always be people who prefer a printed version, or occasions where you need to present a copy of it there and then.</p>
<p>Ensure that your presentation is perfect as the information and style in which you produce it is consistent with the online version, and that you keep a small stock of them at all times. If environmental consciousness or sustainability registers highly on your company radar, then make sure you use recycled paper and sustainable inks etc.</p>
<p>Some organizations also have their media kits available on a flash drive, which may be another method of presentation that you wish to have available.</p>
<p>Many PR professionals say that having a good press kit is just as important as having a good website and online presence. Brainstorm with your team to decide what information you need to share in order to create a kick ass media kit for your business.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../how-to-create-a-media-kit/index.html">How to create a kickass Media Kit for your business</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="../../../../index.html">Hike POS Software</a>.</p>
