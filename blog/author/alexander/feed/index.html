<h2>Pen and Paper vs Traditional POS vs Cloud Based POS</h2>



<p>I want to preface this article by stating <span id="more-53427"></span>that the opinions I express are my own and have come about from having worked for 3 different POS companies in the selling, initial onboarding and ongoing support of Point of Sale systems for 3 years.</p>



<p>In this time, I couldn’t begin to guess how many businesses I have spoken to on the subject of Point of Sale. What is apparent from these interactions is that there are some pretty clear pros and cons to each of the types of POS systems out there. You might be <a href="../../../10-things-that-one-should-consider-when-choosing-a-retail-pos/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thinking about switching</a> from one to another or wondering how to make a decision on this without having to go through the process of trialing each system to see what works best. In this piece I hope to make life a little easier (Just like a good POS system should do) by comparing the different types that are out there.</p>



<h2>Pen and Paper</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="920" height="774" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/pen-and-document-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-53557" srcset="https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/pen-and-document-1.png 920w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/pen-and-document-1-300x252.png 300w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/pen-and-document-1-768x646.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px" /></figure>



<p>The traditional method of running a retail business has always been (up until the last 15 years or so) to use pen and paper. I think it would be unfair to rubbish pen and paper entirely as a method of running a business, but there is a growing sentiment that it has had its day.</p>



<p>Let’s look at what pen and paper has going for and against it.</p>



<p>First off is the cost. There isn’t much of a cost at all, unless you want to talk about the environmental cost of using paper to run a business, but that might be a topic for another day. Generally speaking, when I’ve spoken to someone running their business with pen and paper and asked what has kept them using it to this point, cost is almost always the first thing that is mentioned. It is often followed up with some line about their perceived lack of “tech-savvy-ness”.</p>



<p>To this point though, I would usually ask about the amount of time it takes them to complete certain tasks such as: figuring out how well a product is selling, performing an <a href="../../../tips-relating-to-physical-inventory-count/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inventory count</a> or knowing what a customer tends to buy.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly the answer tends to be ‘quite a while’ or ‘we know by <strong><em>feel</em></strong>’. The point here is that while the monetary cost of pen and paper appears to be very small, it’s the time spent trying to make sense of the numbers and piles of pages that really gets people.</p>



<p>Some other things that work in pen and paper’s favour is the lack of setup time required. Pop down to your local stationary store, draw some grid lines on a page and away you go.</p>



<p>The other is something I touched on before and that’s the fact you don’t need to be ‘tech-savvy’. Although this is all relative, as some would say (as in me) that trying to make sense of mountains of paper in filing cabinets and doing all the necessary mathematics manually; is actually quite a bit harder than using a computer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No setup</td><td>No integrated accounting</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cheapest option</td><td>No online integrations</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Minimal training</td><td>No integrated payments</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>No internet required</td><td>No backup of your data</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>No reporting</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lack of guidance</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>No accountability</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Calculating discounts is manual and slower</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Traditional POS</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="345" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/Traditional-POS.png" alt="" class="wp-image-53503" srcset="https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/Traditional-POS.png 500w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/Traditional-POS-300x207.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure></div>



<p>For the sake of clarity, a traditional Point of Sale or ‘Legacy POS’ system is any system that runs on a computer, but is not ‘cloud based’.</p>



<p>Most of the traditional POS systems out there came about in the early 2000’s and there are plenty still going today. Just as the other POS systems do, they certainly have their reasons for and against.</p>



<p>The first thing that really works in favour of these traditional POS systems is that they are often very industry specific. Certain business types often have one or two very specific needs that relate to their business and it is true that a number of the traditional POS providers tend to have some highly specified POS offerings that aim to cater for these needs. Though this is not to say there aren’t cloud systems that can do the exact same thing.</p>



<p>The next thing is again the price. Now this can be a pro or a con depending on your viewpoint but the fact is that most traditional POS systems charge once off for the program. In the same way that you might pay for Microsoft office once, and then it is yours forever on that computer. I can understand why this can be viewed as a point towards a traditional POS but there’s an important bit of context here; how much <strong><em>is</em></strong> that initial cost?</p>



<p>If you were to go onto the website of a Legacy POS provider and look for the page that says ‘Pricing’, there is a <strong><em>very good chance </em></strong>that you will either not be able to see a page for this at all, or when you go onto the pricing page, you’re met with quite a lot of words and a distinct lack of numbers and $ symbols. Instead, you are instructed to ‘Book a Demo’ only after which you will be told the price. This is because in many cases Legacy POS systems cost several thousand dollars, some even crest the 5 figure mark. I’ve had many conversations over the years with businesses that want to change their POS, as they realise that the system is not working for them, but they feel obliged to stay with it because they’ve spent several thousand dollars to get the software in the first place.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Often the fees are “One-off”</td><td>Initial setup fees are generally higher</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Traditional POS system are sometimes more industry specific</td><td>High support fees (paid support)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sometimes legacy systems become unsupported</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Lack of product updates</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Data is stored on PC and not online (if the program crashes, you lose your work)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>If program isn’t the right fit, can lock you in with the sunk cost fallacy.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>No accountability</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Cloud Based POS</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="785" height="396" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/hardware-4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25552" srcset="https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/hardware-4.png 785w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/hardware-4-300x151.png 300w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/hardware-4-768x387.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 785px) 100vw, 785px" /></figure></div>



<p>Lastly, we arrive at the cloud based Point of Sale systems. The hot new trend. The emerging superpower. All that jazz.</p>



<p>There are a number of reasons why businesses are turning to ‘the cloud’ more than any other type of system these days. Not least of which, is the flexibility and continuous development that a cloud based system can provide. For as long as people have traded money for products it has always been the same deal; I buy the product and if the product becomes outdated or other products start to surpass it, well tough, I guess I’ll just need to buy the newer and better version. This is no longer the case. With cloud POS systems you don’t just purchase the product itself, but also the ongoing development and support that backs up an ever changing system that aims to keep up with the latest trends.</p>



<p>Retail has made some immense steps in the very recent past. With the emergence of more and more online selling platforms to the introduction of highly in-depth accounting systems, to the beginning of the buy now, pay later craze; having a POS system that isn’t committed to developing itself to meet the new demands of retail just doesn’t make sense.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say that cloud based POS systems are always perfect, it’s true that after initial sign up there is some necessity to input all of your products and set up the system to reflect your needs. But with every good cloud POS company, there is a robust knowledge base of help files and videos aimed at making life easier for the user. In Hike’s case, we even offer <a href="../../../../software-features/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">24/7 email and chat support</a> and personalised onboarding services to ease this transition period.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cloud based POS systems also make life much easier to do day to day simple tasks. All of the <a href="../../../inventory-and-sales/index.html">tasks I mentioned earlier </a>that pen and paper struggles with, can be done instantly with a cloud system.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Pros</strong></td><td><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Allows for omni channel selling – online stores</td><td>Some initial setup period is often required</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accounting integrations to save time</td><td>Digitalising product lists to be put into the system</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Easy to view sales history – Customer buying habits</td><td>On-going fee (however can be cancelled anytime)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Integrated gift cards</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Auto calculating discounts</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Manage inventory/purchases all on one system</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>In depth reporting available at a glance</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Accountability fur users/increased managerial oversight</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Times are changing and retail is moving forward with speed. Business owners are finding themselves spread across more tasks than ever before and the payoff for having a system that can take some of these pressures off the business owner is remarkable.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since Facebook was founded in 2004, <span id="more-53152"></span>year by year it has grown into the most widely recognised social media platform on the planet. Now boasting a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">user base of 2.85 billion</a>, it’s no surprise that the blue website has also become a central hub for web marketing and brand awareness in general. </p>



<p>But with all of the noise out there in the world of social media posting with thousands of businesses vying for your attention, you’d be forgiven for wondering how on earth you can get seen on Facebook or whether it’s worth your effort. Read on to get a better understanding of how it all works and where to start!</p>



<h2>Why should I use Facebook?</h2>



<p>While there’s no doubt Facebook is a massive service, other platforms such as Instagram and Snapchat have started to close the gap in recent years, which may lead you to ask if Facebook is still the best option. The fact remains though that in terms of daily userbase Facebook is still streets ahead of the others.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="879" height="516" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/00-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-53168" srcset="https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/00-1.png 879w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/00-1-300x176.png 300w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/00-1-768x451.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></figure>



<p>This is largely due to Facebook’s ability to reach a wider age demographic when compared to Instagram and Snapchat, who have a much more pronounced <a href="https://napoleoncat.com/blog/instagram-users-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fall off after the 25–34-year-old age bracket</a>. This means that using Facebook as the main platform for an advertising campaign can be highly beneficial if you feel your products apply to those in older age brackets as well.</p>



<p>Something else to take into consideration when deciding what platform to advertise on is the criteria that a user must meet in order to be shown one of your ads. An example of this being the difference between Facebook ads vs Google ads.</p>



<p>When a user is shown your advert on Google, it’s because they searched a keyword that is associated with your ad, hence it appearing for the user. This differs to Facebook primarily in the fact that people aren’t actively searching so much for products on Facebook as much as they are just generally on the platform for its social media usage, and ads happen to be there.</p>



<p>This may seem like a minor piece of information but the distinction is important, as it is effectively the difference between driving high conversion on leads that are already somewhat interested in the product or service (Google) vs actively promoting a product or brand to someone that may not have otherwise have been looking/interested in that product (Facebook).</p>



<h2>You want me to pay HOW MUCH?</h2>



<p>Yep, here comes the nitty gritty part but don’t fret! As far as advertising as a whole is concerned, one of Facebook’s most appealing aspects and best arguments for its usage, is in fact its price.</p>



<p>When looking at Facebook advertising costs, there are 2 key metrics to keep in mind. The first one is Cost per Click (CPC). The second is Cost Per Thousand Impressions or sometimes known as Cost per Mille (CPM). The difference in these two is centred mainly around what your goal for the ad is. E.g. do you want to put this ad up primarily for brand exposure and getting your name out there? Or is this ad’s purpose solely to generate clicks and (hopefully!) conversions? If the first option speaks to you, CPM might be best. If it’s the latter that you’re looking for, CPC could be what you need. More on this below.</p>



<p>There are ups and downs to both CPC and CPM but the short of it is that if you are not looking to experiment too much with different ad types and ad campaigns and just want to keep it sweet and simple, then Cost Per Click is probably best for you. This way you only pay for actual interested traffic that has clicked on your ad.</p>



<p>However, Facebook is such a vast space that allows a lot of room for movement and experimenting with different ad types. As such you may feel inclined to try new ad styles with different products or different wording and get an idea of what actually works best for you and your business. If that’s the case then it will be beneficial to pay by CPM as this way your ad’s main purpose is to be put in front of as many people as possible. This way you’ll be charged per thousand people that your ad gets put in front of, whether they engage with it or not.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="844" height="411" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/01-3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-53183" srcset="https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/01-3.png 844w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/01-3-300x146.png 300w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/01-3-768x374.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center smaller">Source: <a href="https://www.webfx.com/social-media/how-much-does-facebook-advertising-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WebFX</a></p>



<p>The above image is on average and it should be mentioned that these numbers can and do change from time to time based on the industry and ad type in question.</p>



<h2>How do I know if it’s working?</h2>



<p>The obvious answer is that you’ll be selling more products. But it goes deeper than that, a lot deeper.</p>



<p>The key element to knowing how your campaign <em>went</em> is to have a clear idea at the start, of where you want your campaign to <em>go. </em>This means setting a campaign goal early on and using that as an initial metric of success. You don’t need to shoot for the moon here, you just need to have an idea in mind of what sort of return you would be satisfied with based on the time and money you’ve invested.</p>



<p>It can also be tricky to know the success of your ad if you don’t have anything to benchmark it against. This touches on an important point that we mentioned earlier. Experiment. Get a few ads out there, try new things and see what works. It isn’t easy to gauge success without anything to measure it against. You could spend a week going through all the information that signifies your ad’s effectiveness. But without getting too bogged down with the analytics and statistics, here are a few indicators that you can look for if you don’t have any previous ads to benchmark against.</p>



<h3><strong>Click Through Rate (CTR)</strong></h3>



<p>Simply put, this is the percentage of people that see your ad and actually click on it. Below is some historical data on the average CTR on Facebook. This obviously isn’t the be all and end all of advert success, but it’s an interesting metric to show how interesting your ad is to your audience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="561" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/02-3-1024x561.png" alt="" class="wp-image-53198" srcset="https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/02-3-1024x561.png 1024w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/02-3-300x164.png 300w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/02-3-768x421.png 768w, https://hikeup.com/wp-content/uploads/02-3.png 1460w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center smaller">Source: <a href="https://www.socialinsider.io/blog/facebook-ads-research/#status" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Socialinsider</a></p>



<h3><strong>Impressions</strong>.</h3>



<p>This is how many Facebook users your advert has been put in front of or “served” to. As mentioned earlier this is a metric based on which you may choose to be charged, so it definitely helps to understand it. The drawback of impressions being that it’s difficult to draw any concrete findings from this statistic as it is not a given that people who see your ad will purchase your product. This is best suited to reach and exposure orientated campaigns.</p>



<h3><strong>Return on Investment/Conversion</strong></h3>



<p>ROI is important in everything you do as a business owner and is of course, in many instances, the main reason for advertising in the first place. Seeing a markable uptick in sales directly from people clicking through your advert and making purchases is the end goal. But as with all of these indicators, it doesn’t necessarily tell the whole story. This doesn’t give voice to those potential customers who saw the ad, were reminded of the business again and are now closer to making a purchase down the track.</p>



<p>The point here is to not feel bogged down with any individual metric but to look at them as a whole and view them through the lens of what your initial goal/target was. After all, while you may be competing with other businesses for the customer’s attention, your main competition is your last ad and trying to improve on that will yield the best results.</p>
